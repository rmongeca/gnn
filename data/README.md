# Data folder

This folder is meant to hold the data used to perform model runs. In particular, it will contain a
subfolder for the data generated by each experiment's _generate_dataset.py_ module, which is ignored
by default in the repository.

In addition, a symbolic link to each example's subdirectory is included in each iGNNition example
folder, as it is directly referenced in the _train_options.yml_ file relative to the example folder.
